        <b>Ingredients</b>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons red miso or 3 tablespoons white miso</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon rice vinegar (originally sake)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar.</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tamari. More if using coconut aminos.</li>
            <li>4 (6-ounce) skinless salmon fillets.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Instructions</b>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Mix the marinade: Mix the miso, vinegar, tamari, and sugar in a small bowl. Adjust proportions to taste. The miso is chunky and will take some coaxing to get the lumps out.</p></li>
            <li><p>Marinate the salmon: Pour half of the mixture into a container large enough to fit the salmon fillets, then pour the rest over the top of the fish. Make sure the fish is coated with the miso sauce.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover the container and marinate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight.</p></li>
            <li><p>Broil the salmon: Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil. Brush a little vegetable oil over the foil and lay the salmon fillets on top. Make sure there is an even, thin coating of marinade on top of the fish.</p></li>
            <li><p>If youâ€™re cutting up a large fish fillet, try to ensure the pieces are as close to the same size as you can get them for even cooking.</p></li>
            <li><p>Place the fillets no closer than about 6 inches from the broiler element in your oven. Broil for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how thick the fillets are and how hot your broiler is (we went for 12.)</p>
            <li><p>Keep an eye on the salmon. The marinade has sugar in it that can easily cause the glaze to burn. If it starts charring and the cooking isn't yet finished, place the fish on a lower rack in the oven.</p>
                <li><p>Serve with rice and stir-fried vegetables.</p></li>
        </ul>
